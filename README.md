abstract = {With the global deployment of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile technology, a new era characterized by ultra-high data speeds, ultra-low latency, and massive connectivity has emerged. However, these advancements also introduce new security and privacy challenges. The integration of new technologies in 5G has fundamentally altered the network structure, rendering traditional security methods inadequate. Artificial intelligence (AI), with its advanced data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities, is a promising solution to enhance security and privacy in 5G networks. While existing surveys discuss AI applications for 5G, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey on the performance of various AI-based solutions for 5G security and privacy. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing an in-depth review of the latest advancements in AI for 5G security and privacy. We begin with an overview of the security and privacy challenges in 5G networks, including potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and privacy issues. We then propose a set of evaluation criteria for assessing various AI-based solutions. Following this, we present a taxonomy of AI-based security and privacy solutions and review the latest advancements. Finally, we identify open issues and propose future directions for utilizing AI to enhance 5G security and privacy.},
